# tsmean
The python package for Time Series Averaging under Dynamic Time Warping.

Time series averaging under DTW is formulated as an optimization problem. A (Fréchet) mean of a time series dataset is any time series x that minimizes the Fréchet function

$$F(x) = \sum_{y \in X} \text{dtw}(x,y)^2.$$
